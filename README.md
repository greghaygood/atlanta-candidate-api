## Development Notes

### Database

Disclaimer: Heroku [encourages](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5) using PostgreSQL in development to maintain parity between dev/prod environments.

But, to get things going right out of the box without having a local Postgres server, you can explicitly specify an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database by typing the following prior to starting your local server:

```shell
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:db/development.sqlite3
```
